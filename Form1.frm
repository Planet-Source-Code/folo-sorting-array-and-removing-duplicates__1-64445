'   TriQuickSortString ' Sorts the string array.  // when the distance gets below 5, which speeds things A LOT (over 40%).
'
'   The following code is a demonstration of how to remove duplicates
'   from a string array as quickly as possible. The program first uses
'   the very fast TriQuickSort algorithm to sort the array after it has
'   been dimensioned and populated. Then it uses the remdups sub to remove
'   any possible duplicates from the array. remdups assumes that you don't
'   want any vbNullString in your array, if you would, then just replace
'   vbNullString in the remdups sub with any other character, like Chr$(1),
'   or whatever that floats your boat. This code can be used to remove
'   duplicates from arrays that contains hundreds of thousands of entries,
'   even millions. And it's very fast.
'
'   I hope you enjoy it!
'
'   Enjoy!
