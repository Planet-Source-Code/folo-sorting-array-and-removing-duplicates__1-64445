## Sorting array and removing duplicates


</div>

### Description

The following code is a demonstration of how to remove duplicates from a string array as quickly as possible. The program first uses the very fast TriQuickSort algorithm to sort the array after it has been dimensioned and populated. Then it uses the remdups sub to remove any possible duplicates from the array. remdups assumes that you don't want any vbNullString in your array, if you would, then just replace vbNullString in the remdups sub with any other character, like Chr$(1), or whatever that floats your boat. This code can be used to remove duplicates from arrays that contains hundreds of thousands of entries, even millions. And it's very fast.
